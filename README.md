🎓 Student Grades Management with Streams
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Java Streams to manage and analyze student grades.
It includes filtering, mapping, aggregating, and sorting operations on a list of students.

📂 Structure

🔹 Operations with Streams

Given a List<Student>, use Streams to:

Filter students who passed (grade ≥ 7).

Map the names of approved students to uppercase.

Calculate the average of all grades.

Find the highest and lowest grade.

🎯 Extra Challenge

Sort the students by grade in descending order using Streams.
